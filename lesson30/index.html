        CompSci lab, 2 o’clock in the morning, filled with students desperately
        trying to get their various left-to-the-last-night projects to compile.
        One poor 1st year, in tears and clutching a brick of printouts to his
        chest, sidles over to a older kid who is pouring over a dozen text
        books. “It… it… won’t run!”, he sobs. holding out his last chance to
        stay at university and out of the army. The older boy glances at the
        print out and points a line. “Missing a comma at the end there.” The 1st
        year looks down and then cries out with joy! “Wow! How did you do that?
        CompSci Student Teacher?” “No. 2nd year commerce.” came the tired
        response, “But everyone else here has been whining about missing commas
        all night. Seemed a good guess.” … My friend tells this bloody story
        every time I see him! He’s a chef now. On TV nonetheless, and he still
        can’t program worth a damn.
